    <h2>Fun facts about Campari</h2>
        <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li>Campari was invented in 1860 by Gaspare Campari in Novara, Italy.</li>
            <li>The only known ingredients in Campari are water and alcohol. These are blended together then infused with "bitter herbs, aromatic plants and fruit," according to the company. Nothing else is revealed, including how many ingredients are used or what they may be. Many speculations abound, including that the bitterness comes from the chinotto citrus fruit.</li>
            <li> It was originally coloured with carmine dye, derived from crushed cochineal insects, which gave the drink its distinctive red colour. It didn't discontinue the use of Carmine until 2006.</li>
            <li>In 1904, Campari's first production plant was opened in Sesto San Giovanni, near Milan, Italy. Under the direction of Davide Campari, Gaspare's son, the company began to export the beverage, first to Nice in the heart of the French Riviera, then overseas.</li>
            <li>The Campari brand is now distributed in over 190 countries.</li>
            <li>Campari's prominent flavor is that of a strong bittersweet orange. It's very complex and there are notes of cherry, clove, and cinnamon as well. It's one of the most bitter spirits you will taste, which adds to its appeal for many drinkers.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Campari is featured in many classic cocktail recipes. The <a href="https://uproxx.com/life/best-cocktail-negroni/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Negroni</a> is arguable the best cocktail you can make. There is even a <a href="https://negroniweek.com/">week long celebration</a> fundraiser celebrating the 100 years of the cocktail.</a></p>
